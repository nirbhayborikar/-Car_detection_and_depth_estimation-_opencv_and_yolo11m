folder_1: data_used 

In this folder all the data is used are present which is later modified from Src code.
and then the output data saved in outputimages folder.( folder_3)

folder_2:
It contains two file first one is detecting car and calculating efficiency and training the YOLO Model.

The second file is for calculating the distance from camera car to detected object basically detected car.

folder_3:

All the data that is processed with source code is stored here in images form.
------------------------------------------------------------

At last the PDF File is also included, which has all the theory behind the approach taken and output images, mathematical models of all the techniques in code used. File name: Car_detection_YOLO_Report.pdf
