CONCLUSION:
In reflection on the results, the observed error percentages and anomalies in depth estimation using a single monocular camera highlight significant limitations, making it unsuitable as the sole source of depth information. Critical factors such as uneven gradients in the driving surface, lens distortion, the accuracy of object detection models, and proper calibration significantly influence the overall performance.

Additionally, discrepancies in the number of car detections between the ground truth annotations and YOLOv11m outputs were observed. Addressing this issue could involve enhancing the ground truth dataset with additional car detections to reduce mismatches. Furthermore, if the objective is to detect only a specific class of objects, training a custom YOLO model tailored for that class using a specialized dataset may yield more precise results.
Despite these limitations, monocular camera-based depth estimation remains viable in certain scenarios, such as highway environments. It can serve as a practical solution for vehicles lacking radar sensors by assisting in maintaining safe following distances and providing driver alerts in situations of close proximity.

Ultimately, by utilizing a subset of the KITTI dataset comprising the necessary images and calibration data, the task of vehicle depth estimation was successfully achieved. This was accomplished through the construction of a two-dimensional geometric model to estimate the unknown depth.
